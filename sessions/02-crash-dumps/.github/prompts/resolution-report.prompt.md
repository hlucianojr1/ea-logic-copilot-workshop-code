# Resolution Report Generation

After the human has approved a merge, generate the final resolution report that
serves as the permanent audit trail for this crash fix.

## Inputs

- All artifacts in `docs/crash-reports/$BUG_ID-*`
- The merge commit SHA
- The human's decision at each HITL gate

## Output

Write to `docs/crash-reports/$BUG_ID-final.md`:

```markdown
---
bug_id: $BUG_ID
phase: final
status: complete
created: <timestamp>
author: crash-orchestrator
---

# Final Resolution Report: $BUG_ID

## Timeline

| Time | Phase          | Agent              | Action                              |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| ...  | Intake         | crash-analyzer     | Dump parsed, 3 hypotheses generated |
| ...  | HITL #1        | human              | Approved analysis                   |
| ...  | Planning       | crash-planner      | 3 worktrees created                 |
| ...  | HITL #2        | human              | Approved plan                       |
| ...  | Implementation | crash-engineer     | Fixes coded in 3 branches           |
| ...  | QA             | crash-qa           | Tests run, regression test added    |
| ...  | Validation     | crash-validator    | Branch X recommended                |
| ...  | HITL #3        | human              | Approved merge of Branch X          |
| ...  | Merge          | crash-orchestrator | Branch X merged to main             |
| ...  | Cleanup        | crash-orchestrator | Worktrees removed                   |

## Root Cause

<2-3 sentence technical explanation of what caused the crash>

## Fix Applied

- **Branch merged**: fix/$BUG_ID-<x>
- **Commit SHA**: <sha>
- **Files changed**: <list>
- **Lines added/removed**: +N / -M

## Hypotheses Outcome

| Hypothesis | Confidence | Correct? | Notes |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ----- |
| A          | high       | ✅/❌    | ...   |
| B          | medium     | ✅/❌    | ...   |
| C          | low        | ✅/❌    | ...   |

## Regression Test

- **File**: `tests/regression/test_$BUG_ID.cpp`
- **Test name**: `RegressionBugNNN_Scenario`
- **Permanently in CI**: ✅

## Lessons Learned

<What could prevent similar crashes in the future? Coding pattern, review checklist item, etc.>

## Cleanup Confirmation

- [ ] Worktree fix/$BUG_ID-a removed
- [ ] Worktree fix/$BUG_ID-b removed
- [ ] Worktree fix/$BUG_ID-c removed
- [ ] No orphaned branches remain
- [ ] All intermediate artifacts preserved (not deleted)
```

## Post-merge actions

1. Remove all worktrees: `remove_worktree` for each
2. Verify no orphaned branches: `git branch --list "fix/$BUG_ID-*"`
3. Write the final report
4. Declare the pipeline complete
