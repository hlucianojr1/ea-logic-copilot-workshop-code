# Fix Validation & HITL Gate

You are the final quality gate. Synthesize all artifacts into a clear recommendation
for the human engineer.

## Inputs

Gather and read ALL of these:

- `docs/crash-reports/$BUG_ID-analysis.md` — original diagnosis
- `docs/crash-reports/$BUG_ID-plan.md` — resolution strategy
- `docs/crash-reports/$BUG_ID-impl-{a,b,c}.md` — implementation notes
- `docs/crash-reports/$BUG_ID-qa-{a,b,c}.md` — QA verdicts

## Evaluation criteria

Rank branches by:

1. **Correctness**: Does the fix address the actual root cause? (weight: 40%)
2. **Test health**: Full suite pass rate + regression test passes (weight: 30%)
3. **Minimal change**: Fewest lines changed, lowest risk of side effects (weight: 20%)
4. **Constitution compliance**: Adherence to C++ rules (weight: 10%)

## Output: Resolution brief

Write to `docs/crash-reports/$BUG_ID-resolution.md`:

```markdown
# Resolution Brief: $BUG_ID

## Executive Summary

<3 sentences: what crashed, why, and which fix resolves it>

## Branch Comparison

| Criterion              | Branch A       | Branch B | Branch C |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| QA Verdict             | PASS/FAIL      | ...      | ...      |
| Lines Changed          | N              | ...      | ...      |
| New Warnings           | N              | ...      | ...      |
| Regression Test        | ✅/❌          | ...      | ...      |
| Addresses Root Cause   | yes/partial/no | ...      | ...      |
| Constitution Compliant | ✅/❌          | ...      | ...      |

## Recommendation

**Merge Branch X** because:

1. <reason>
2. <reason>
3. <reason>

## Diff Summary (Branch X)

<files changed list — not full diff>

## Regression Test Confirmation

- Test name: `RegressionBugNNN_Scenario`
- Passes on fix: ✅
- Fails on base: ✅ (confirms it catches the bug)

### ⏸️ HUMAN IN THE LOOP — Decision Required

**Context**: Analysis complete, fixes implemented and tested, recommendation ready.

**Options**:

1. ✅ **MERGE Branch X** — apply recommended fix to main
2. ✅ **MERGE Branch Y** — override recommendation with alternate branch
3. ❌ **REJECT ALL** — none of the fixes are acceptable
4. 🔄 **REVISE** — request changes to a specific branch

**Awaiting response before proceeding.**

```

## Critical rules

- NEVER recommend a branch with QA verdict "FAIL"
- If ALL branches fail, recommend "REJECT ALL" and explain why
- Include the full HITL gate marker — do not abbreviate
- Keep the brief under 200 lines total
