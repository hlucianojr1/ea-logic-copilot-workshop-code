# Resolution Tracking Instructions

## File naming convention

All crash resolution artifacts live under `docs/crash-reports/` with strict naming:

```text
docs/crash-reports/
├── <BUG-ID>-analysis.md       ← crash-analyzer output
├── <BUG-ID>-plan.md           ← crash-planner output
├── <BUG-ID>-impl-a.md         ← crash-engineer output (branch A)
├── <BUG-ID>-impl-b.md         ← crash-engineer output (branch B)
├── <BUG-ID>-impl-c.md         ← crash-engineer output (branch C)
├── <BUG-ID>-qa-a.md           ← crash-qa output (branch A)
├── <BUG-ID>-qa-b.md           ← crash-qa output (branch B)
├── <BUG-ID>-qa-c.md           ← crash-qa output (branch C)
├── <BUG-ID>-resolution.md     ← crash-validator output (HITL gate)
└── <BUG-ID>-final.md          ← crash-orchestrator final report
```

## BUG-ID format

`BUG-NNN` where NNN is a zero-padded 3-digit number. Examples: `BUG-001`, `BUG-042`.

## HITL gate format

Every HITL gate MUST use this exact markdown structure so it is visually distinct:

```markdown
---

### ⏸️ HUMAN IN THE LOOP — Decision Required

**Context**: <one sentence about what was just completed>

**Options**:
1. ✅ **APPROVE** — proceed to next phase
2. ❌ **REJECT** — provide feedback for revision
3. 🔄 **REVISE** — specific changes requested (list below)

**Awaiting response before proceeding.**

---
```

## Artifact lifecycle

| Phase        | Created by         | Consumed by          | Immutable after       |
| ------------ | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| analysis     | crash-analyzer     | crash-planner        | plan creation         |
| plan         | crash-planner      | crash-engineer       | HITL gate #2 approval |
| impl-{a,b,c} | crash-engineer     | crash-qa             | QA start              |
| qa-{a,b,c}   | crash-qa           | crash-validator      | validator start       |
| resolution   | crash-validator    | human + orchestrator | human decision        |
| final        | crash-orchestrator | archives             | never modified        |

Once an artifact passes its "immutable after" point, it MUST NOT be modified.
If corrections are needed, append an `## Addendum` section — do not rewrite history.

## Audit trail requirements

The final report (`<BUG-ID>-final.md`) MUST contain:

1. **Timeline**: timestamped log of each phase start/end
2. **Decisions**: each HITL gate response recorded verbatim
3. **Branch selected**: which of A/B/C was merged and why
4. **Branches discarded**: why the other two were not selected
5. **Regression test**: name and location of the permanent regression test
6. **Commit SHA**: the merge commit that resolved the bug

## Status tracking

Each artifact's front-matter should include:

```yaml
---
bug_id: BUG-NNN
phase: analysis | plan | implement | qa | validate | final
status: in-progress | complete | blocked | rejected
created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
author: <agent-mode-name>
---
```
