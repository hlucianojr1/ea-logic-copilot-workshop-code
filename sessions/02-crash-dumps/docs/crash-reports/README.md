# Crash Reports

This directory holds all artifacts produced by the agentic crash dump resolution pipeline.

Files are generated automatically by the crash-dump SDLC agents. Do NOT create or edit
files here manually — they are produced by the following agents:

| File pattern              | Producer           | Phase           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| `BUG-XXX-analysis.md`     | crash-analyzer     | Intake/Analysis |
| `BUG-XXX-plan.md`         | crash-planner      | Planning        |
| `BUG-XXX-impl-{a,b,c}.md` | crash-engineer     | Implementation  |
| `BUG-XXX-qa-{a,b,c}.md`   | crash-qa           | QA              |
| `BUG-XXX-resolution.md`   | crash-validator    | Validation      |
| `BUG-XXX-final.md`        | crash-orchestrator | Final           |

See [agentic-architecture.md](../agentic-architecture.md) for the full system design.
